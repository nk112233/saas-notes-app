## ‚ú® About the Project

The `saas-notes-app` is a comprehensive web application designed to provide users with a secure and intuitive platform for creating, organizing, and managing their notes. Built with a robust JavaScript-based backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) and a dynamic frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), it offers a seamless experience for personal information management with a focus on user authentication and data persistence.


## üöÄ Features

*   üîê **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
*   ‚úçÔ∏è **Create & Manage Notes:** Intuitive interface to create, edit, view, and delete personal notes.
*   üìÇ **Organized Notes:** Ability to list and browse all personal notes efficiently through a user-friendly dashboard.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Data Security:** Encrypted passwords using `bcrypt` and secure API communication to protect user data.
*   üåê **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Properly configured for seamless frontend-backend communication.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the `saas-notes-app` locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
*   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (running locally or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nk112233/saas-notes-app.git
    cd saas-notes-app
    ```

2.  **Environment Configuration:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Open the newly created `.env` file and update the placeholder values:

    ```ini
    # Example .env content
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/saasnotes
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
    ```

    *   `PORT`: The port for the backend server.
    *   `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    *   `JWT_SECRET`: A strong, random string for signing JWTs.

3.  **Backend Setup (API):**

    Navigate to the `api` directory, install dependencies, and start the server:

    ```bash
    cd api
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified `PORT`).

4.  **Frontend Setup:**

    Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, install dependencies, and start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    The frontend application should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.


## üí° Usage Examples

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser.

1.  **Access the Application:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Register:** Create a new user account with a unique email and password.
3.  **Login:** Log in with your registered credentials.
4.  **Manage Notes:** Start creating, editing, and deleting your personal notes from the user dashboard.
